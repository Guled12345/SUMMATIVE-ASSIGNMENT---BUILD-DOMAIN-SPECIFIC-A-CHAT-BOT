🤖 EDUCATION CHATBOT SUMMATIVE

📌 1- PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Education Chatbot Summative is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students and educators. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to answer academic queries, recommend study resources, and enhance the learning experience. This project demonstrates the use of Transformer models in the education sector.

📂 2- DATASET
The chatbot is trained on an education-related dataset that includes:

📖 Textbooks & Lecture Notes: Extracted knowledge from academic sources.

📚 FAQs & Study Materials: Frequently asked student questions and their answers.

📜 Wikipedia & Open Educational Resources: General knowledge and explanations.

👉 To train the chatbot on a new dataset, place it in the data/ folder and modify preprocessing scripts in src/.
