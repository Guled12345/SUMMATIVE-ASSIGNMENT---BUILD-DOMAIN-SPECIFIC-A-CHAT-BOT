🤖 EDUCATION CHATBOT SUMMATIVE
📌 1- PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Education Chatbot Summative is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students and educators. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to answer academic queries, recommend study resources, and enhance the learning experience. This project demonstrates the use of Transformer models in the education sector.

📂 2- DATASET
The chatbot is trained on an education-related dataset that includes:

📖 Textbooks & Lecture Notes: Extracted knowledge from academic sources.
📚 FAQs & Study Materials: Frequently asked student questions and their answers.
📜 Wikipedia & Open Educational Resources: General knowledge and explanations.

👉 To train the chatbot on a new dataset, place it in the data/ folder and modify preprocessing scripts in src/.

🔄 3- PROJECT WORKFLOW
🛠️ 1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and tokenized text data.
Applied text normalization and stopword removal.
Encoded text data using word embeddings.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
🤖 2. Model Training
Used a Transformer-based NLP model (e.g., T5, BERT, GPT) for question-answering tasks.
Applied fine-tuning on educational queries.
Optimized hyperparameters for better performance.
📈 3. Model Evaluation
Assessed model accuracy using loss functions and evaluation metrics.
Used validation datasets to measure performance.
Fine-tuned the model based on evaluation results.
💬 4. Chatbot Interaction
Developed an interactive chatbot for real-time Q&A.
Tested the chatbot’s ability to provide relevant academic responses.
📊 4- VISUALIZATIONS
Plotted word frequency distribution to analyze common terms in the dataset.
Displayed dataset balance to ensure fair model training.
Generated loss and accuracy graphs to track model improvement.
🏆 5- RESULTS
✅ Achieved high accuracy in answering academic queries.
✅ Successfully generated context-aware responses.
✅ Improved model coherence through fine-tuning and training strategies.
